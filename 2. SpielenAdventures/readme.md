# Mods für MinetestEdu
... die das machen, wofür "eigentlich" Minecraft und Minetest geschaffen worden sind: zum Spielen :-)
(gegen die "Didaktisierung" der Gamificaton :-)
Super wäre es, eigene Games zu erstellen - also Minetest für das zu benutzen, für das es - neben dem Spielen - ursprünglich geschaffen wurde: 
um einfach eigene Mods, Welten, Erweiterungen (mit der Programmiersprache LUA) zu erstellen :-)

Es gibt einige interessante Games, die man einfach in den /game Ordner zieht ...

Hier git es eine Tabellarische Übersicht über die momentan verfügbaren Subgames von minetest - mit folgenden 

##Genres

- Sandbox: There are no particular goals, the gameplay is mostly up to the player. If the sandbox has a notable focus, use one of the following sub-genres:
- Survival Sandbox: This is for sandboxes with a focus on challenging gameplay. Common elements are hostile enemies, hunger, etc.
- Creative Sandbox: A sandbox with a strong focus on creativity and no or almost no gameplay challenge. Note that Creative Mode alone does not count; the sandbox must have a strong creative aspect in the normal game mode as well
- Space Simulation: For games in which the player travels through space (a single foreign planet doesn't count!) 
- Hack and Slay: The main focus is to battle hordes of stronger and stronger monsters or other enemies, while trying to stay alive as long as possible, killing many monsters, getting a high score, or achieving a similar goal
- PvP: For games where the core gameplay is player-vs-player combat, either all vs all or team-based. Examples are capture the flag, deathmatch, etc.
- RPG: For games which are itself roly-playing games (RPGs) or games which primarily (!) incorporate many gameplay elements commonly found in RPGs. This includes things like experience points, skills, quests, a story arc, many characters, dialogs, etc.
- Puzzle: Goal is to find a solution to one or multiple given problems. This includes logic puzzles, math puzzles, thinking games, etc.
- Not a game: Not a game

#Story
Long time ago, the world of rpgtest was a nice place. People invented machines, built gigantic structures and explored the world. But after some time the world of rpgtest suddenly turned into a scary place to live. For some reason, monsters started spawning everywhere. Normal people were not able to live normally in this world anymore. They decided to build houses in trees, because monsters weren't able to climb up things. For some that worked pretty well, but others had problems getting food up there. A group of explorers had a different idea, they decided to build islands in the sky, far away from their hometown. They build a complete ecosystem on these islands and were able to live there by doing so. When they had a basic food source, they sent back some good explorers to try and find the others.
